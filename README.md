Synapse is a free and open-source Flutter app that allows your to interact with LLM without network connection. The app is built using Flutter and compatible with Android and iOS.

---

## Getting Started ðŸš€

This project contains 3 flavors:

- development
- staging
- production

To run the desired flavor either use the launch configuration in VSCode/Android Studio or use the following commands:

```sh
# Development
$ flutter run --flavor development --target lib/main_development.dart

# Staging
$ flutter run --flavor staging --target lib/main_staging.dart

# Production
$ flutter run --flavor production --target lib/main_production.dart
```

_\*Synapse works on iOS, Android._

---

## Running Tests ðŸ§ª

To run all unit and widget tests use the following command:

```sh
$ flutter test --coverage --test-randomize-ordering-seed random
```

To view the generated coverage report you can use [lcov](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov).

```sh
# Generate Coverage Report
$ genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/

# Open Coverage Report
$ open coverage/index.html
```

## App Requirements

- iOS 13 or above
- Android?
- The app has been tested on iPhone 11 (with a little glitch) and Pixel 6 so I think the requirements would be 4GB of RAM or more.
